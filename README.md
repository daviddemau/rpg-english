# Fantasy War

This HTML/CSS/JavaScript project is a strategic turn-based rpg game.
Goal is to gather valuable ressources before your opponent does, in order to engage in a terrible fight with better chances to win.
Game ends when one player dies. Goal of this project in my learning process is to learn to apply OOP programming in a more complex application.
Hope you enjoy playing this game!
