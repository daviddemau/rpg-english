This HTML/CSS/JavaScript project is a strategic turn-based rpg game. Goal is to gather valuable ressources before your opponent does, in order to engage in a terrible fight with better chances to win. Game ends when one player dies. Goal od this project in my learning process is learning to apply OOP programming with more lines of code and for a more complex application. Hope you enjoy playing this game!
